This project is for a pre-assignment for IMA Low Res Connections Lab 2024. 
Taught by Craig Protzel, with the kind assistance of Pim Tournaye. 

This is an ongoing project documenting the sauna culture in Vital Brooklyn sauna. 

It's an experiment looking at extreme weather conditions of high temperatures. 
The conversations which happen in the sauna. 
The haikus around and within.
And the wider sauna culture around the world. 

As temperatures rise, what are you doing to prepare against the heat?

// I used fundamental css for this version. In the future I'd like to use frameworks such as Tailwind.css
